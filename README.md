# Geometry Mapping

- The goal is to create a hexagon from equilateral triangles generated in from the centre in a clockwise motion. I have a functional loop that represents the current 'ring' and the current 'edge' being created.

Diagonals of a Hexagon
- The hexagon is a polygon with six sides, and six vertices. Like any polygon, a hexagon can be either convex or concave. When convex, a hexagon has none of its angles greater than 180째. On the contrary, concave hexagons have one or more of its angles greater than 180째. A hexagon is called regular when all of its sides and interior angles are equal. Unlike a triangle, having equal sides does not imply that the interior angles are also equal, since they may be concave. Many possible concave hexagons can be created with equal sides, but unequal interior angles. Any hexagon that is not regular is called irregular. The sum of internal angles of any hexagon, either convex or concave, is always 720째. This can be easily concluded by counting the number of triangles fitting inside the hexagon, by its vertices. Indeed, there are 4 triangles. Since the sum of internal angles in one triangle is equal to 180A, triangles, side by side, should measure up to 4*180 = 720째.
